# Objective: Refresh on C++ and programming in general. Compression program using the huffman algorithm. 

**Plan:** Once compression algorithm is done, tested, and validated... Create separate program (perhaps in Python) to check target directories once a day and check for outdated files. Eg. If a file hasn't been modified/opened in 30 days, compress it to save space on local disk.
